# Info

The site is built with [Harp](http://harpjs.com), using [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for templating and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) / [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for CSS pre-processing. To see how this works in detail, check out my [Ultimate Guide to Static Websites with Harp & Jade](https://ines.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-static-websites-harp-jade).
