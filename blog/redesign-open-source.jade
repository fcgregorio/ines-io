include ../_includes/_mixins

p I always enjoy redesigning my site. It's the ideal place to try out new things, and I just love the rush of excitement and motivation that comes with it. This time, I didn't only go for a new look, I also gave the templates and build system a modern makeover and published it all under an open source license. Read more about it below and #[a(href="https://twitter.com/" + profiles.twitter target="_blank") let me know] what you think. ðŸŽ‰

h2 Static Site Generator

p Even though I only just wrote an #[a(href=url + "/blog/the-ultimate-guide-static-websites-jekyll" target="_blank") extensive guide] praising #[a(href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank") Jekyll], I decided on #[a(href="http://harpjs.com" target="_blank") Harp] for my static CMS. I'm still a big fan of Jekyll and highly recommend it, but while looking for the ideal static website compiler for an upcoming project, I came across Harp and immediately fell in love with its straightforward setup and out-of-the-box pre-processing. Combined with #[a(href="http://jade-lang.com/" target="_blank") Jade], a clean templating language that compiles to HTML, you can build powerful and dynamic templates with only a bare minimum of files and practically no theme bloat, using partials (dynamic includes), #[a(href="http://jade-lang.com/reference/mixins/" target="_blank") mixins] (reusable flexible content elements) and, if needed, #[a(href="http://jade-lang.com/reference/code/" target="_blank") JavaScript expressions]. I love minimalist code and this is probably one of the cleanest sites I have ever written â€“ and at the same time one of the most automated and structured ones.

h2 Front-End

p Harp makes it very convenient to write and build CSS. I've been using #[a(href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank") Sass] as my pre-processor of choice for quite some time now and with the help of #[a(href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" target="_blank") Autoprefixer] (which is included in Harp by default), I finally got to build the responsive flexbox grid of my dreams without much hassle. When Flexbox became more or less widely supported, it felt like a minor revelation. And once you've #[a(href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties" target="_blank") figured it all out], it makes aligning elements almost enjoyable â€“ at least until #[a(href="http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2016/02/01/deep-dive-into-grid-layout-placement/" target="_blank") grid layouts] are supported by all major browsers and become #[a(href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid" target="_blank") safe enough] to use.

p Visually, I went for a cleaner look using more whitespace, less noise, a bigger font size, #[a(href="https://www.fontshop.com/families/proxima-nova" target="_blank") Proxima Nova] for the body text and one of my favourites, #[a(href="https://www.grillitype.com/typefaces/gt-walsheim" target="_blank") GT Walsheim] bold oblique, for headlines. I came across this typeface sometime last year and immediately fell in love with its friendly boldness and precision. I usually grow tried of fonts pretty fast, but this one still makes me smile everytime I see it.

h2 Open Source

p I've been thinking about publishing more of my code for a while and ultimately, it's not even such a big deal. I've worked on open source projects, but ironically I've always been pretty hesitant when it comes to sharing and open sourcing my own stuff. But I've decided to challenge that and publish the source of my blog on #[a(href="https://github.com/" + profiles.github + "/ines-io") GitHub] from now on. All content and code, except for blog posts, blog images and selected assets, is published under the MIT license, which means you can use it freely and however you like. I'd always appreciate a link back to this blog â€“ and I'd love to see what you build with it â€“ but it's not required.
